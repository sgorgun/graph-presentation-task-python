# Graph representation

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* Representations of graphs in memory
* An adjacency matrix as a data structure for representing graphs in memory
* An adjacency dictionary as a data structure for representing graphs in memory

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Implementing the `Adjacency matrix` interface for undirected graphs
* Implementing the `Adjacency dictionary` interface for undirected graphs
