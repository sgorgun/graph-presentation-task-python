# Graph representation

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test knowledge of the following concepts:

* Representation of graph in memory
* Adjacency matrix as a data structure for representing graphs in memory
* Adjacency dictionary as a data structure for representing graphs in memory

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Implementing `Adjacency matrix` interface for undirected graphs
* Implementing `Adjacency dictionary` interface for undirected graphs
